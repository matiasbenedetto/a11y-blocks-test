# Accessibility Gutenberg blocks test
‚ÑπÔ∏è Proof of concept motivated by: https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/39266


**Tool to automate the a11y checks of each Gutenberg block rendering the block as the final user will receive it (theme particularities included).**

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning**: Don't run this package over a production WordPress instance because it need to write some sample data to the site (example: It will upload a site logo if there if the site has not one defined previously). **Use it only with test WordPress instances**.

## üôã FAQs
### Why?
Because we need a fast way to test each Gutenberg block for potential accesibility issues.

### How it works?
For each block this package follow these steps (using [Wordpress E2E test utilities](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-e2e-test-utils/)):
- Creates mock data if it's necesary
- Creates a new post
- Inserts blocks with mock data
- Previews the rendered block
- Tests the final bblock rendered output using [`axe-core`](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-jest-puppeteer-axe/)
- Reports the results
