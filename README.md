# A11y Gutenberg blocks test
A tool to automate the a11y checks of each Gutenberg block rendering the block as the final user will receive it (theme particularities included).

## Warning
Don't run this package over a production WordPress instance because it need to write some sample data to the site (example: It will upload a site logo if there if the site has not one defined previously). **Use it only with test WordPress instances**.

## FAQs
- **Why?** Because we need a fast way to test each Gutenberg block for potential accesibility issues.

    - Create mock data if it's necesary
    - Creates a new post
    - Inserts blocks with mock data
    - Preview the rendered block
    - Test the final bblock rendered output using [`axe-core`](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-jest-puppeteer-axe/)
